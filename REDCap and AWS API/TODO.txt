it would probably also be good to have an additional twenty empty fields in case they went to have additional information

Specifically, could you:
1.  Set up individual AWS and REDCap accounts for each of the three teams.  I will send you e-mails shortly that summarize each of their projects.

2.  In addition, I think it would be okay to share with the students the specific code you have written to access the AWS and REDCap databases--Dr. Sheth, one of the course directors, had mentioned this was okay.

3.  Could you send them a screenshot of the fatigue app log-on screen and one of the user screens so that they can replicate that general "style"?  The fatigue app had an image of a cartoon sleeping--please remove that.

Could you do items 1 and 2 at your earliest convenience as the students have started working on the projects.

Kind regards,
