# About TrueVault

TrueVault is a secure API to store health data. We make HIPAA compliance easier for healthcare applications. 

## Built for Developers Like You
Store and search protected health information (PHI) in any file format with a simple RESTful API. No pre-defined schemas to follow.

## HIPAA Compliant
We handle all of the technical requirements mandated by the HIPAA Security Rule. Typical integration takes days and saves months of dev time.

## BAA + Insurance
TrueVault will sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA), and protects customers under a comprehensive Privacy/Data Breach insurance policy.

**TrueVault is great for:**

## Startups
TrueVault was built to help startups simplify the complexities of HIPAA. TrueVault will save you hundreds of dev hours. Focus on building your software's core functionality, and let TrueVault protect your data at HIPAA-security levels.

## Mobile Apps
Store your app's protected health data in TrueVault. We take care of HIPAA so that you can focus on creating healthcare apps on any platform.

## Web Apps
You don’t have to worry about setting up and maintaining your own HIPAA compliant application stack. TrueVault will handle the Physical and Technical Safeguards required by HIPAA.

## Wearable Health Tech Devices
Emerging technology dances the line between consumer health data and PHI. Sharing data with a HIPAA-defined Covered Entity (such as a doctor) makes the data PHI and it needs to be protected at HIPAA-security levels.
