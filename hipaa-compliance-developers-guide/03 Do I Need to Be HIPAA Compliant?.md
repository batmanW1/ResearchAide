# Do I need to be HIPAA compliant?

This is the most important question you can ask, because HIPAA violations can result in some serious penalties.

**If you handle, store or transmit protected health information (PHI) to or from a covered entity then you need to be HIPAA compliant.** 

If you skipped straight here and don't know what PHI is, read [this part of the guide](https://github.com/truevault/hipaa-compliance-developers-guide/blob/master/02%20What%20is%20HIPAA%3F.md#protected-health-information-phi).

## Who needs to be HIPAA compliant?

The short answer is that the HIPAA rules apply to both Covered Entities and their Business Associates. [HHS.gov](http://HHS.gov)
